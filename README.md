# Acorn Connect
A basic social network concept built in a day on Google Apps Script. As far as lean startups are concerned, this is effectively our MVP. I apologise profusely in advance for the code - it legitimately is a drunken mess.

## WTH is this all about?
Acorn Connect is supposedly a place where young entrepreneurs can seek industry mentors/co-founders to help them with their projects/startups. Once a project is created, mentors and other entrepreneurs express interest and request to collaborate. 

## Features
* Login System
* Project Creation (but not editing/deletion)
* Messaging
